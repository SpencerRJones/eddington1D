Eddington 1D Plane Parallel RT:

	Version 2.1

	-Subroutine mie_rain_mp added to calculate scattering by
		raindrops according to a Marshall-Palmer DSD, which
		is considered a special case of a more general gamma
		distribution. Code checks to see if Marshall-Palmer 
		conditions are satisfied, i.e. mu=0 and n0 = 8000.
	-Subroutine mie_ciw added to calculate scattering by cloud
		ice assuming monodisperse with a fixed density = 0.1
		g/cm^3 and particle size of radius = 30 um.
	-Cloud water assumed monodisperse with radius = 100 um.
	-mie_snow scattering subroutine changed to explicit
		calcualations with variable density and assumed
		inverse exponential distribtution.
	-Gas absorption changed to allow MonoRTM or eddington 
		absorption. MonoRTM lookup tables supplied for GMI
		frequencies.
